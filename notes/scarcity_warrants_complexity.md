# Scarcity Warrants Complexity

_This is a record of my own view of my work, and why it matters. This is a working document - as I will discuss, I believe all valuable works must be mutable and change with time._

## What Could Be
_What could be_ is the numeraire of value. The early life of __insert important self-made person here__ is interesting because of what the person would become, not what he was. How many aspiring young men have dreamed of what they may be, only to become nothing, and like so many blades of grass been cut by time  to be replaced by new men who would meet the same fate? Their stories are many and equally uninteresting in as far as they have no internal coherence. Their early actions beget nothing valuable, and there is no natural progression; the only story is that of what _may have been_. This is why one must seek problems which are valuable and beget future rewards: solving them yields meaning, and their solutions have temporal permanence which makes one's effort forever meaningful. One's narrative naturally follows the arc which meaning requires. As of writing this I'm 22, and I'm ready to begin climbing towards whatever my teleological ends is. To ever reach it, and to feel the satisfaction in the struggle of striving towards it, I must attempt to describe it and delineate it. If I never reach it — reaching one's ends may be impossible — then at least the struggle will have been meaningful. The struggle, being the default state in life, must be meaningful, otherwise the great thrust of life is meaningless.

In my experience meaning in labor is derived from solving interesting problems. What constitutes an interesting problem, and which categories of problems are worth trying to solve? This is broadly the subject of this work, but god knows where I'll take this in time. The question of what is interesting is important because knowing this is necessary to know which problems _aren't_ interesting and aren't worth investing effort into. And so I intend to here describe the properties shared by interesting problems. Using these I'll delineate between the interesting and uninteresting.

## Complexity
A problem must be complex to be interesting. Complexity demands creativity and the complete commitment of one's intellectual faculties in designing a solution. Working on complex problems naturally lulls me into a flow-state in which nothing but a sense of complete focus envelops me. My favorite passtime is running, and when in this flow-state I feel as I do after I've been running for a long period of time. Although my mind wonders at first, by the time I've run five or so miles I am focused and mentally steady. Once I realize that I've reached this point I feel content because I know that when I'm done running the endorphins will continue to wash over my brain. Just the thought of these future rewards leads to a feeling of absolute contentedness and satisfaction in the moment, even before I've finished. The highest form of satisfaction is the satisfaction which one feels after having struggled with a difficult task and solved it. Problems which aren't complex (in some way) are simple and therefore solving them does not yield the kind of satisfaction which I desire. Note that complexity is relative to one's knowledge and experience, and as one becomes better at one's pursuits the requisite amount of complexity required to make a problem challenging naturally increases.

In short, complexity is a necessary trait of interesting problems because it's a necessary condition for reaching the flow-state.

## Valuable Solutions
A flow-state is not only a product of mental commitment, however, and another necessary condition for entering such a state is the belief that the work which one is engaging in has geniune value. One must feel that one is exerting oneself wholly in the pursuit of something worth pursuing to transcend the natural suspicion which one has toward the exertion of energy in the pursuit of something. Thus the notion that solving a problem is valuable in some way to someone is another necessary condition for reaching the flow-state and therefore for a problem to be interesting.

### Productiveness and Reproductiveness
For a problem to be valuable its solution must beget more interesting problems, themselves interesting and therefore worth solving. It must have the potential to lead to something greater and more interesting. Since the necessary conditions for interestingness include value, these potential problems must in turn come with their own value in solving. In this way interesting problems beget interesting problems which beget more value, and so on. 

This "reproducibility" of interesting solutions is motivated by a deep desire that one's work have permanence and therefore that the waves they generate continue to extend across time. What I'm saying is that the solution to an interesting problem must in some way have within it the capacity to become more than what it is originally, to spread and multiply. 

Solutions are like multicellular organisms. They are highly complex, and inherent in their structure and function is the capacity to enure the continued viability of their genes. They are like links in a chain which strive to extend the chain, and from the chain untold chains may branch out and spread into new and unimaginable spaces.

Why must valuable things be reproductive in this way? Because if they do not have this capacity to persist in time, then they must not have generated something valuable. If they had, then, at least in as far as their fruits beget future profits, broadly construed, for those who possessed them, they persist.

If this is a hard pill to swallow then I agree. I'm here only interested in justifying my own views and attempting to unify them into a coherent narrative. The truth is that my views regarding what problems are interesting are themselves the product of a kind of evolutionary mental process unfolding in my head which is continually changing course as new information affects it. To expect them to be consistent is quite a high bar, but consistency is nonetheless necessary for intelligibility, i.e. for me to explain my own thoughts. 

### Ownership
One must have the unilateral freedom to experiment and try many things in solving a problem for it to be interesting. And one must have the freedom to approach it in any way which seems appropriate with as few external constraints binding his actions. The beauty of the problem is that, when working on its solution, there is only it and you. There is no one else telling you what to do, because you are the foremost expert on it, being the person trying to solve it. This is the primary importance of ownership.

Ownership is also in everyone's best interest. Like a renter, unconcerned with maintaining his apartment, someone who has no ownership over his work cannot be expected to invest much of himself in it. But there'e more to ownership and unilateral control of a project than this. Ownership allows one to identify the project with himself, and in this way to derive meaning from it. The solution is his and no his alone.

_Notes:_

__A unified framework to make sense of the managerie of projects. Scarcity is the tension which makes complex systems valuable and worth creating.__

__Important themes:__
- Dynamism and evolutionary development - this work is an expression of an evolving set of constraints including emotional desires, the bounds of my own knowledge, changes in the larger world, etc. It seems wrong to value any artifact for what it is - it must be seen as the expression of an evolutionary process, itself incomplete and transient in some sense. The value in anything I make lies in what it _may be_ rather than what it is, i.e. the evolutionary desendents of it. All things are transient but what matters is that they may lead to something valuable. Here we constrain value to the class of models which solve scarcity problems. Things are static are invaluable because value for the agent is intrinsically identified with the labor of the agent - that which is valuable is that which I create and will create. If the object is static then no labor is or will be put into it. An important relationship is that between labor and time - labor is measured in time, and thus value, a product of labor, is proportional to the amount of time put into the object. This is essentially a narrow construal of the labor theory of value, which is of of course a heterodox economic view but nonetheless I believe a good first approximation to the way in which I view my work. I'm not suggesting that it somehow describes the real world in any way, but that it describes my own views of my own labor. I like it because it excites me - it excites me to think of something not as it is, but as an expression of a process, the aggregrate of forces which have acted on it since its creation and will continue to act on it until its forgotten. From seemingly unimportant artifacts complex and extremely valuable things may spring forth, and these are, on this view, identified with their ancestors as a coherent whole.

- Complexity and sophistication - interesting problems are complex and warrant analysis through interesting frameworks e.g. evolutionary game theory. Such analysis is interesting in as far as it may yield nontrivial solutions to scarcity problems whose value is a product of their capacity to increase the net "wealth" of their creator and users.
