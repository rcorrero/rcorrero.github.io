# [About Richard Correro](https://www.richardcorrero.com)

I'm a technical program manager at the Stanford University School of Medicine. My work is focused on developing machine-learning models and deploying them efficiently at scale for use with massive geospatial datasets. I work in collaboration with an interdisciplinary team of researchers at Stanford centered on the Stanford Human Trafficking Data Lab. I've contributed to many open-source geospatial software projects and I'm committed to the cause of democratizing geospatial intelligence.

I recently graduated with a MS in statistics from Stanford University. In 2021, I received a BS in mathematical and computational science at Stanford.
