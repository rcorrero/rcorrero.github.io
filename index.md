# Projects
_Principle over particulars_


### Current Projects (In Progress)
- [charcoal](https://github.com/rcorrero/charcoal) — The goal of this project is to develop a machine-learning-based system which uses remotely-sensed data to identify locations where forced labor is being used to produce charcoal. This system will help authorities to eliminate and prevent human trafficking.
- [poisson](https://github.com/rcorrero/poisson) — A system to identify small fishing vessels in satellite imagery. [This map](files/chimbote_map.html) shows the locations of vessels detected near the port of Chimbote, Peru. Using a convolutional neural network, the vessels were detected from 393 satellite images taken over a one-year period. With this system regulators can identify and prevent illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing. Paper forthcoming.

### Imagery
#### Astrophotography
- [M33 (Triangulum galaxy)](files/2021_1_12_m33_02_processed.png). Created from 25 60" exposures I captured from my backyard on the night of January 12, 2021.
- [M45 (Pleiades)](files/2021_1_4_m45_01_processed.png). Made with 22 45" sublights captured on January 3, 2021. 
- [M31 (Andromeda galaxy)](files/2020_12_26_stack_2_enchanced_2_rotated.png). Created from 8 50" exposures captured on December 26, 2020.

#### Wildlife
- [Eight point white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus)](files/DSC_0889.JPG). I took this image on woodland in north central Mississippi on December 24, 2020 at 7:07 AM.

#### Scenery
- [Big Sur coastline](files/big_sur_dsc3161.png). Captured by me on June 15, 2021.
- [Big Sur at dusk](files/big_sur_dsc3235.png). Also taken on June 15, 2021.
