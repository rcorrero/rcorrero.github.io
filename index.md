- [Game Choice and Investing Effort](notes/game_choice.md)

### Current Projects (In Progress)
- [poisson](https://github.com/rcorrero/poisson) – [This map](files/chimbote_map.html) shows the locations of vessels detected near the port of Chimbote, Peru. Using a convolutional neural network, the vessels were detected from 393 satellite images taken over a one-year period.
