>Be not afeard; the isle is full of noises,
Sounds and sweet airs, that give delight, and hurt not.
Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments
Will hum about mine ears; and sometime voices,
That, if I then had waked after long sleep,
Will make me sleep again: and then, in dreaming,
The clouds methought would open, and show riches
Ready to drop upon me; that, when I waked,
I cried to dream again.

From [_The Tempest_](http://shakespeare.mit.edu/tempest/full.html), Act III, Scene II. 

# Projects

### Current Project
I’m currently developing a system to identify human-trafficking using remotely-sensed/geospatial data. Some of the code I’m developing may be found [here](https://github.com/rcorrero/slrgd).


### Past Projects
- [poisson](https://github.com/rcorrero/poisson) — A system to identify small fishing vessels in satellite imagery. [This map](files/chimbote_map.html) shows the locations of vessels detected near the port of Chimbote, Peru. Using a convolutional neural network, the vessels were detected from 393 satellite images taken over a one-year period. With this system regulators can identify and prevent illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing. Paper forthcoming.

- [brumaire](https://github.com/rcorrero/brumaire)
- [online-snorkel](https://github.com/rcorrero/CS-229-Final-Project/tree/master/project_code)
- [Clustering Capital Market Returns using Mixture Models](https://github.com/rcorrero/clustering-capital-markets)
- [Housing Price-Prediction Using Elastic-Net Regularized Regression](https://github.com/rcorrero/enet-house-prices)

### Papers
- ["Weak Supervision with Incremental Source Accuracy Estimation"](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Weak-Supervision-with-Incremental-Source-Accuracy-Correro-rcorrero/7686a15a46690ccedb598fff0ecdc34d0474af0f)

### Imagery
#### Astrophotography
- [M33 (Triangulum galaxy)](files/2021_1_12_m33_02_processed.png). Created from 25 60" exposures I captured from my backyard on the night of January 12, 2021.
- [M45 (Pleiades)](files/2021_1_4_m45_01_processed.png). Made with 22 45" sublights captured on January 3, 2021. 
- [M31 (Andromeda galaxy)](files/2020_12_26_stack_2_enchanced_2_rotated.png). Created from 8 50" exposures captured on December 26, 2020.

#### Wildlife
- [Eight point white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus)](files/DSC_0889.JPG). I took this image on woodland in north central Mississippi on December 24, 2020 at 7:07 AM.

#### Scenery
- [Big Sur coastline](files/big_sur_dsc3161.png). Captured by me on June 15, 2021.
- [Big Sur at dusk](files/big_sur_dsc3235.png). Also taken on June 15, 2021.
