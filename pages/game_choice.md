# Game Choice and Investing Effort

Many interesting problems are reducible to machine learning problems which means that the tools of ML are widely applicable. Computer science is valuable primarily because many problems are reducible to algorithmic problems â€“ the distinction between algorithmic solutions and "machine-learning" being only the existence of randomness in the problem itself. Because many problems are reducible to problems of algorithmic design/implementation the tools of CS, the languages we use and the techniques we learn, are broadly applicable within many domains and therefore allow for more unilateral freedom in terms of choosing which "games" to play. The universe of assets in which you may invest your effort is enlarged thanks to this reducibility.

Because of this reducibility you are also playing two games at any given time. Broadly these may be categorized as 
- Problem Formulation: Identifying problems based on interest; determining how to formulate problems within a ML framework and select an evaluation metric; Finding available inputs (data) to solve the problem, etc.
- Problem Solving: Using the tools of ML (and optimization and statistics and CS, etc.) to solve the problem

Reducibility means that the process of problem-solving may be abstracted away from the particulars of any given problem. Thus, rather than investing effort in finding the solution to a problem which may or may not yield to analysis, you may instead invest your time in learning the techniques which are problem-agnostic. This view implies a shift in your values: the distribution of effort must be much more biased towards improving skill with the widely-applicable tools and away from understanding domain-specifics. Solving any problem requires understanding its particulars, of course, but this understanding is not the ultimate aim.

The problem provides you with a game to play. The point is to learn how to apply techniques which may be used in many other games, and learn these techniques well enough that you can win at those games, too.
