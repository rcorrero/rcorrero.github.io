# Running

__Total distance run per year (as measured by my fitness tracker device):__
- 2021: 2,094 mi (3,370 km)
- 2020: 1,931 mi (3,108 km)
- 2019: 1,805 mi (2,905 km)
- 2018: 721 mi (1,160 km)

My total caloric expenditure attributable to running in 2021 was about 262,000 (kilo)calories, equivalent to roughly 162 lbs (73 kg) of [jelly beans](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/2045688/nutrients). I try to average at least 6 miles (10 km) per day.

[Here](files/heart_rate_paper.pdf) are the results of a study I conducted analyzing the effect of behavioral factors on average heart rate while running. This study used a [resolution IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_factorial_design#Resolution) fractional factorial design to test four factors in eight trials. An interesting conclusion is that fasting before running significantly reduces average heart rate (although I was the only test subject, so it's unclear whether [these results generalize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_validity)).
